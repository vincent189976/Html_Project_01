    <h1 align="center">A List of Vincent's Favourite Films</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I have been an avid cinema lover for as long as I can remember. I watch films to understand the world better. Films bridge the gap between the absurdity of cinema & the mediocrity of reality. As Camus reflects, 'It is that divorce between the mind that desires & the world that disappoints, my nostalgia for unity, this fragmented universe & the contradiction that binds them together.' Below I have compiled a list of few of my favourite films. I would love to discuss them with you. You can contact me via Email. Thanks for checking out my webpage!</p>

            <h2>Blade Runner (1982)</h2>
            <p>This is my all time favourite film. Aside from its breathtaking neo-noir visuals & Scott's immaculate direction, it questions the veracity of humanity as well as the plausibility of a plastic identity.</p>

            <h2>No Man's Land (1987)</h2>
            <p>Set against the backdrop of neon-lit, smoky 80s Los Angeles, this film explores the moral paradox of an undercover cop who develops a close relationship with the leader of a car theft ring.</p>

            <h2>Taxi Driver (1976)</h2>
            <p>Scorsese explores the volatility of a crime-infested, drug-ridden 70s New York City through the eyes of a traumatized war veteran, Travis Bickle.</p>
